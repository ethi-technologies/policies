### What information Ethi does not collect

We do not intentionally collect “**[Sensitive Personal Information](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-9-gdpr/)**”, such as personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, and the processing of genetic data, biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, data concerning health or data concerning a natural person’s sex life or sexual orientation.

- Any data that you provide Ethi via upload or connection to external online services is only used for the sole purpose of providing you with the Ethi Service.

#### Our legal bases for processing information

Because the processing of your User Personal Information is subject to certain international laws (including, but not limited to, the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)), we need to notify you about the legal basis on which we process User Personal Information. Ethi processes User Personal Information on the following legal bases:

- Contract Performance:
  * When you create a Ethi Account, you provide your Registration Information. We require this information for you to enter into the Terms of Service agreement with us, and we process that information on the basis of performing that contract. We also process your username and email address on other legal bases, as described below.
  * If you have a paid Account with us, we collect and process Payment Information and additional elements on the basis of performing the transactions and contract that applies to those services.
- Consent:
  * We rely on your consent to use your User Personal Information under the following circumstances: when you fill out user profile information; when you decide to participate in a Ethi project, beta program, or survey; and for marketing purposes, where applicable. All of this User Personal Information is entirely optional, and you have the ability to access, modify, and delete it at any time, with the exception of your email address which is a requirement to hold an account. You may withdraw your consent or/and delete your account at any time.
- Legitimate Interests:
  * We may process some of your User Personal Information for things that are covered by "legitimate interest". Examples of "legitimate interest" are if we need to use your User Personal Information to contact you about your account, to ensure legal compliance, for security, or to make sure Ethi’s systems, Website, or Service are working properly.
- If you would like to request deletion of data we process on the basis of consent or if you object to our processing of personal information, please use our email us at contact@ethi.me. If you would like to remove the personal data you provided ethi post-registration, you may do so in the Data Choices section of your user profile.

### How we share the information we collect

We may share your User Personal Information with third parties under one of the following circumstances:

#### With your consent
We share your User Personal Information, if you consent, after letting you know what information will be shared, with whom, and why. For example, if you wish to connect to an Ethi feature that uses a third-party data provider, you may be asked to share your email address, or other pieces of information, for instance to verify your identity. 

#### For legal disclosure
Ethi aims for full transparency with users if we ever need to use your User Personal Information to comply with legal process and legal obligations (we hope we don't!). Unless prevented from doing so by law or court order, we make as good an effort as we are reasonably able to notify users of any legally compelled or required disclosure of their information. Ethi aims to never have to disclose any encrypted, user-uploaded data, but may disclose User Personal Information to law enforcement if legally required in response to a valid subpoena, court order, search warrant, a similar government order, or when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to comply with our legal obligations, or to protect the public at large. We don't believe this will ever happen.

#### Change in control or sale
If we are involved in a merger, sale, or acquisition of corporate entities or business units, may share User Personal Information with the acquiring party. If any such change of ownership happens, we will notify you on our Website or by email before any transfer of your User Personal Information and we will ensure that it is under terms that preserve the confidentiality of User Personal Information. The organization receiving any User Personal Information will have to honor any promises we made in our Privacy Statement or Terms of Service.

#### Aggregate, non-personally identifying information
We may share certain aggregated, non-personally identifying information such as statistics on the aggregate usage of individual features, statistics on how our users collectively use Ethi, or how our users respond to our other offerings, such as events.

We **do not** sell your User Personal Information for monetary gain or share it in return for any other other consideration. We may in the future help individuals to aggregate and monetise their data, but only if they very clearly and explicitly choose to consent to this, and we do not currently have plans to do so.



### Additional services

#### Third party applications

You have the option of enabling or adding third-party applications to your Account. These are not necessary for your use of Ethi. We will share your User Personal Information with third parties when you ask us to, however, you are responsible for how much you share and your use of the third-party products. 

### How you can access and control the information we collect

If you're already a Ethi user, you may access, update, alter, or delete your basic user profile information by editing your user profile or data choices, or by contacting Ethi Support. You can control the information we collect about you by limiting/deleting any information is in your profile, by keeping your information current, or by contacting Ethi Support.

#### Data retention and deletion of data

Generally, Ethi retains User Personal Information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services.

If you would like to cancel your account and delete the associated personal data or delete your User Personal Information, you may do so in your user profile. We retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements, but barring legal requirements, we will delete your full profile (within reason) within 90 days of your request.
