### The Magicflow Terms of Service

### A. Definitions
**Short version:** *We use these basic terms throughout the agreement, and they have specific meanings. You should know what we mean when we use each of the terms. There's not going to be a test on it, but it's still useful information.*

1. An "Account" represents your legal relationship with Magicflow. A “User Account” represents an individual User’s authorization to log in to and use the Service and serves as a User’s identity on Magicflow.
2. The “Agreement” refers, collectively, to all the terms, conditions, notices contained or referenced in this document (the “Terms of Service” or the "Terms") and all other operating rules, policies (including the Magicflow Privacy Statement, available at [https://magicflow.com/policies/privacy](https://magicflow.com/policies/privacy)) and procedures that we may publish from time to time on the Website.
3. "Beta Previews" mean software, services, or features identified as alpha, beta, preview, early access, or evaluation, or words or phrases with similar meanings.
4. “Content” refers to content featured or displayed through the Website, including without limitation code, text, data, articles, images, photographs, graphics, software, applications, packages, designs, features, and other materials that are available on the Website or otherwise available through the Service. "Content" also includes Services.
5. “Magicflow,” “We,” and “Us” refer to Ethi Technologies, Inc. - the legal company behind the trading name Magicflow, as well as our affiliates, directors, subsidiaries, contractors, licensors, officers, agents, and employees.
6. The “Service” refers to the applications, software, products, and services provided by Magicflow, including any Beta Previews.
7. “The User,” “You,” and “Your” refer to the individual person, company, or organization that has visited or is using the Website or Service; that accesses or uses any part of the Account; or that directs the use of the Account in the performance of its functions. A User must be at least 13 years of age.
8. The “Website” refers to Magicflow’s website located at [magicflow.com](https://magicflow.com/), and all content, services, and products provided by Magicflow at or through the Website. It also refers to Magicflow-owned subdomains of magicflow.com, such as [community.magicflow.com](https://community.magicflow.com/) or [app.magicflow.com](https://app.magicflow.com/). Occasionally, websites owned by Magicflow may provide different or additional terms of service. If those additional terms conflict with this Agreement, the more specific terms apply to the relevant page or service.

### B. Account Terms
**Short version:** *Users control their Account and content with it; a human must create your Account; you must be 13 or over; you must provide a valid email address; and you may not have more than one free Account. You alone are responsible for your Account and anything that happens while you are signed in to or using your Account. You are responsible for keeping your Account secure.*

#### 1. Account Controls
- Users. Subject to these Terms, you retain ultimate administrative control over your User Account and the Content within it.

#### 2. Required Information
You must provide a valid email address in order to complete the signup process. Any other information requested, such as your real name, is optional, unless you are accepting these terms on behalf of a legal entity (in which case we need more information about the legal entity) or if you opt for a [paid Account](#k-payment), in which case additional information will be necessary for billing purposes.

#### 3. Account Requirements
We have a few simple rules for User Accounts on Magicflow's Service.
- You must be a human to create an Account. Accounts registered by "bots" or other automated methods are not permitted. We do not permit machine accounts.
- One person or legal entity may maintain no more than one free Account.
- You must be age 13 or older. Magicflow does not target our Service to children under 13, and we do not permit any Users under 13 on our Service. If we learn of any User under the age of 13, we will [terminate that User’s Account immediately](#l-cancellation-and-termination). Your country’s minimum age may be older; in such a case, you are responsible for complying with your country’s laws.

#### 4. User Account Security
You are responsible for keeping your Account secure while you use our Service. We offer tools to help you maintain your Account's security, but the content of your Account and its security are up to you.
- You are responsible for all activity that occurs under your Account.
- You are responsible for maintaining the security of your Account and password. Magicflow cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.
- You will promptly [notify Magicflow](mailto:contact@magicflow.com) if you become aware of any unauthorized use of, or access to, our Service through your Account, including any unauthorized use of your password or Account.

#### 5. Additional Terms
In some situations, third parties' terms may apply to your use of Magicflow. For example, you may be a member of an organization on Magicflow with its own terms or license agreements; you may download an application that integrates with Magicflow; or you may use Magicflow to authenticate to another service. Please be aware that while these Terms are our full agreement with you, other parties' terms govern their relationships with you.

### C. Acceptable Use
Your use of the Website and Service must not violate any applicable laws, including copyright or trademark laws, export control or sanctions laws, or other laws in your jurisdiction. You are responsible for making sure that your use of the Service is in compliance with laws and any applicable regulations.

You agree that you will not under any circumstances violate our [Acceptable Use Policies](https://magicflow.com/policies/acceptable-use).

### D. Intellectual Property Notice
**Short version:** *We own the service and all of our content. In order for you to use our content, we give you certain rights to it, but you may only use our content in the way we have allowed.*

#### 1. Magicflow's Rights to Content

We reserve all rights that are not expressly granted to you under this Agreement or by law. The look and feel of the Website and Service is copyright © Magicflow, Inc. All rights reserved. You may not duplicate, copy, or reuse any portion of the HTML/CSS, Javascript, or visual design elements or concepts without express written permission from Magicflow.

#### 2. Magicflow Trademarks and Logos

### E. API Terms
**Short version:** *You agree to these Terms of Service, plus this Section H, when using any of Magicflow's APIs (Application Provider Interface), including use of the API through a third party product that accesses Magicflow.*

Abuse or excessively frequent requests to Magicflow via the API may result in the temporary or permanent suspension of your Account's access to the API. Magicflow, in our sole discretion, will determine abuse or excessive usage of the API. We will make a reasonable attempt to warn you via email prior to suspension.

You may not share API tokens to exceed Magicflow's rate limitations.

All use of the Magicflow API is subject to these Terms of Service and the [Magicflow Privacy Statement](https://magicflow.com/policies/privacy).

Magicflow may offer subscription-based access to our API for those Users who require high-throughput access or access that would result in resale of Magicflow's Service.

### F. Payment
**Short version:** *You are responsible for any fees associated with your use of Magicflow. We are responsible for communicating those fees to you clearly and accurately, and letting you know well in advance if those prices change.*

#### 1. Pricing
Our pricing and payment terms, when set up, will be available at [magicflow.com/pricing](https://magicflow.com/pricing). If you agree to a subscription price, that will remain your price for the duration of the payment term; however, prices are subject to change at the end of a payment term.

#### 2. Upgrades, Downgrades, and Changes
- We will immediately bill you when you upgrade from the free plan to any paying plan.
- If you change from a monthly billing plan to a yearly billing plan, Magicflow will bill you for a full year at the next monthly billing date.
- If you upgrade to a higher level of service, we will bill you for the upgraded plan immediately.
- You may change your level of service at any time by [choosing a plan option](https://magicflow.com/pricing). If you choose to downgrade your Account, you may lose access to Content, features, or capacity of your Account. Please see our section on [Cancellation](#l-cancellation-and-termination) for information on getting a copy of that Content.

#### 3. Billing Schedule; No Refunds
**Payment Based on Plan** For monthly or yearly payment plans, the Service is billed in advance on a monthly or yearly basis respectively and is non-refundable. There will be no refunds or credits for partial months of service, downgrade refunds, or refunds for months unused with an open Account; however, the service will remain active for the length of the paid billing period. In order to treat everyone equally, no exceptions will be made.

**Payment Based on Usage** Some Service features are billed based on your usage. A limited quantity of these Service features may be included in your plan for a limited term without additional charge. If you choose to purchase paid Service features beyond the quantity included in your plan, you pay for those Service features based on your actual usage in the preceding month. Monthly payment for these purchases will be charged on a periodic basis in arrears.

#### 4. Authorization
By agreeing to these Terms, you are giving us permission to charge your on-file credit card, PayPal account, or other approved methods of payment for fees that you authorize for Magicflow.

By using the Service, you agree to pay Magicflow any charge incurred in connection with your use of the Service.  If you dispute the matter, contact [Magicflow Support](mailto:contact@magicflow.com). You are responsible for providing us with a valid means of payment for paid Accounts. Free Accounts are not required to provide payment information.

### G. Cancellation and Termination
**Short version:** *You may close your Account at any time. If you do, we'll treat your information responsibly.*

#### 1. Account Cancellation
It is your responsibility to properly cancel your Account with Magicflow. You can cancel your account at any time by going into your User Profile within the Magicflow app. The Account page provides a simple, no questions asked cancellation link. We are not able to cancel Accounts in response to an email or phone request.

#### 2. Upon Cancellation
